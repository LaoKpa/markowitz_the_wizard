This repository is intended to present the code developed for my MBA conclusion work (or final project):

## Optimizing diversified investment portfolios considering cryptocurrencies and other Brazilian financial products, using Markowitz model approach, GARCH models and Genetic algorithms.

The objective behind this project is to expose the real behaviour regarding portfolios composed by Brazilian company stocks and cryptocurrencies, considering metrics such as risk and return.

This is for the ones that may find this useful!

*** PD: *** Such as the work was based on Markowiz efficient frontier models, the name of this repository is dedicated to him!
*** PD 2: THE CODE IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS! Hope to finish it soon! ***

ENJOY IT!
