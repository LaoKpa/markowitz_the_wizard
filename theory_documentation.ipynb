    "Recently we have been witnesses of the massive hype around cryptocurrencies, used as an investment asset rather than a currency as well. Considering that from 2013 until now, there has been a bias regarding the trends in their price and real value; for instance, if we compare the price of the most famous cryptocurrency nowadays on the market (and the first one), Bitcoin, in different long-time intervals, an enormous difference is perceived between them: While in May 2013 its price never surpassed the $ 150 (US currency) threshold, in December 2017 its price reached its peak with $ 19.535,70.\n",

    "Such kind of facts, generate a significant misunderstanding about the risks and volatility implied in dealing with these markets where the less financial educated population are the most vulnerable. \n",

    "Precedents in Latin America countries, including Brazil and Colombia, could be pointed out using examples like when Forex market was widely introduced and began to operate in these countries. Several intermediate fraud schemas rised (including pyramidal schemas) intending to collect population money using speeches based on biased facts such as the hyperinflation of bitcoin price mentioned above. The success of this schemas was caused mainly because of the effectiveness of their speeches empowered by the lack of financial education of the targeted population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, similar fraud schemas based on cryptocurrencies speculation investment born in this case due either the lack of knowledge in finance and/or cryptocurrencies concept and the gaps existing due the absence of policies and laws to regulate such markets regardless the attempts encouraged by countries like China, Japan, Sweden and others, of framing out an efficient regulatory policy in this matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it is clear that even for more educated population, is still hard to evaluate and have a broader sight about the real potential risks and gains when investing in these currencies in certain markets such as the Brazilian one. Consequently, this work aims to overcome the problems pointed above by delivering clearer evidences regarding the real behavior of these assets in diversified portfolios using “Efficient frontier Markowitz model”, evolutionary-based algorithms and VaR metric (Value at Risk).\n",

    "The history regarding financial markets stands over several failures which led to important advances in the matter for the sake of failure prevention and smarter decisions. In 1987 for instance, soon after the stock market crash, the lack of means and tools for measuring the potential risk of an asset under certain market conditions led to the development of Value at Risk (VaR) and since then has seen widespread use across financial services organizations until it was standardized in 1999 by the Basel agreement (eafit) [spark analytics].\n",

    "\n",
    "Along with this happening but independently, advances in technology with the capability of defining the economic scenario in the years to come were being developed. That is the case of Blockchain, the technology behind the most famous cryptocurriencies, where the later ones (Bitcoin specifically) were the first succeed implemented applications of Blockchain in 2008. \n",

    "After these events, with new players in the economy and considering the non-stable scenario fed by the past crisis, turned the market more volatile and hard to predict, thus surviving such contexts requires more sophisticated tools and strategies to manage investments more “correctly”. \n",

The key insight regarding this framework is that an asset risk and return, should be assesed by how it contributes to a portafolio's overall risk and return, rather that by itself [1 - ref. wikipedia]. \n",

    "It is an extension of diversification in investing, where is assumed that owning different type of assets is less risky than owining just one type. Harry Markowitz introduced MPT in 1952, and such work led him to be awarded a with Nobel price in economics[2 - wikipedia].\n",
